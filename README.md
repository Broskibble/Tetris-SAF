# The SAF Game Engine:
Saf is a small and lightweight Game-Engine, its sortof like a fantasy console,

SAF Display - 64 x 64 display with 256 colors (332 palette) and framebuffer (double buffering) - 25 FPS
SAF Input - 7 buttons (arrows, A, B, C).

The reason I use SAF is because it can export to small arduino based platforms:

Supported platforms (frontends):
  - SDL2 (two versions: feature-rich and minimal)
  - CSFML (SFML binding for C)
  - Emscripten (web browser JavaScript)
  - X11
  - ncurses (terminal)
  - Pokitto
  - Arduboy
  - Gamebuino META
  - ESPBoy
  - Circuitmess Nibble
  - Circuitmess Ringo
